This is the core AMF library.

This library produces an object tree to represent the content of an AMF file.  Existing AMF (or STL) files can be parsed into an object tree.

The object tree can then be traversed, and the the data within can be extracted for display.

The object tree can be written losslessly to an AMF file, or (with some loss) to an STL file.

AMFCore is licenced under the Mozilla license.
